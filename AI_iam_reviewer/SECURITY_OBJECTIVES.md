---

## 🎯 Primary Security Objectives

### 1. **Proactive Security Posture Improvement**

**Objective:** Move from reactive to proactive security by identifying and preventing issues before they become incidents.

**How We Achieve This:**
- **Unused Access Detection:** AI analyzes Access Advisor data combined with business context to identify stale roles/users for immediate removal
- **Privilege Escalation Prevention:** Specialized prompts detect `iam:PassRole`, `sts:AssumeRole`, and other escalation vectors with specific remediation steps
- **Attack Surface Reduction:** Continuous identification of unnecessary permissions, wildcard access, and overly broad resource scoping
- **Threat Vector Analysis:** AI understands policy combinations that create security risks beyond simple rule-based detection

**Evidence of Success:**
```bash
# Validation test confirms proactive capabilities
✅ Proactive Unused Role Detection: Found unused roles with 120+ days inactivity
✅ Privilege Escalation Detection: Detected iam:PassRole without resource restrictions
✅ Proactive Security Recommendations: Generated specific improvement actions
```

### 2. **Access Control Excellence**

**Objective:** Ensure least privilege access with proper controls and conditions for all IAM entities.

**How We Achieve This:**
- **Wildcard Permission Detection:** AI identifies `Action: "*"`, `Resource: "*"`, and service-level wildcards with specific scoping recommendations
- **Condition-Based Controls:** Prompts specifically check for missing MFA, IP restrictions, time-based access, and VPC conditions
- **Resource Scoping Analysis:** AI evaluates whether permissions are appropriately scoped to specific resources vs wildcards
- **Usage-Based Optimization:** Combines Access Advisor data with policy analysis to recommend permission reductions

**Evidence of Success:**
```bash
# Validation confirms access control capabilities
✅ Wildcard Permission Detection: Identified excessive wildcard permissions
✅ Least Privilege Assessment: Provided access optimization recommendations
✅ Condition-Based Access Control: Recommended MFA and IP restrictions
```

### 3. **Persona-Based Role Management**

**Objective:** Ensure each IAM role follows security patterns appropriate for its intended use case.

**How We Achieve This:**
- **Standardized Persona Classification:** AI classifies roles into 6 security personas (Human Interactive, Service Execution, Application Workload, Cross-Account Access, Administrative Break-Glass, Automation Pipeline)
- **Persona Security Validation:** Each persona has specific security requirements that are automatically validated
- **Trust Policy Analysis:** AI ensures trust relationships match the intended persona usage patterns
- **Baseline Configuration Enforcement:** Each persona must meet FedRAMP High baseline requirements

**Persona Security Requirements:**
- **Human Interactive:** MFA conditions, session limits, IP restrictions
- **Service Execution:** Service principals only, minimal permissions
- **Cross-Account Access:** ExternalId conditions, strict monitoring
- **Administrative Break-Glass:** Comprehensive logging, time limits

**Evidence of Success:**
```bash
# Validation confirms persona management
✅ Human Role Persona Detection: Correctly identified HUMAN_INTERACTIVE roles
✅ Service Role Persona Detection: Correctly identified SERVICE_EXECUTION roles
✅ Cross-Account Role Persona Detection: Correctly identified CROSS_ACCOUNT_ACCESS roles
✅ Persona Security Validation: Validated security controls for each persona type
```

### 4. **FedRAMP High Baseline Compliance**

**Objective:** Ensure continuous compliance with FedRAMP High baseline configuration standards.

**How We Achieve This:**
- **NIST 800-53 Control Mapping:** AI automatically maps IAM configurations to specific controls (AC-2, AC-6, AU-6, CA-7, SI-4)
- **Baseline Deviation Detection:** Real-time identification of configurations that don't meet FedRAMP High standards
- **Compliance Evidence Generation:** Automated creation of audit evidence for compliance reviews
- **Continuous Monitoring:** EventBridge integration provides real-time compliance assessment of policy changes

**NIST Control Coverage:**
- **AC-2 (Account Management):** Automated account lifecycle and usage monitoring
- **AC-6 (Least Privilege):** AI-powered privilege analysis and optimization
- **AU-6 (Audit Review):** Automated security finding generation and analysis
- **CA-7 (Continuous Monitoring):** Real-time security posture assessment
- **SI-4 (System Monitoring):** Advanced anomaly detection and alerting

**Evidence of Success:**
```bash
# Validation confirms FedRAMP compliance capabilities
✅ NIST Control Mapping: Maps configurations to AC-2, AC-6, AU-6, CA-7, SI-4 controls
✅ Baseline Compliance Assessment: Provides meets_baseline assessment
✅ Audit Evidence Generation: Generates compliance evidence automatically
✅ FedRAMP-Specific Findings: Creates findings mapped to specific NIST controls
```

### 5. **AI Hallucination Prevention**

**Objective:** Ensure AI analysis is factual, evidence-based, and never speculates on missing information.

**How We Achieve This:**
- **Evidence-Required Findings:** Every security finding must cite specific policy statements or configuration evidence
- **Structured Output Validation:** Enforced JSON schemas prevent malformed or speculative responses
- **Factual Constraint System:** Prompts explicitly prohibit assumptions about missing data
- **Security-First Prompt Engineering:** Advanced prompts designed to prevent false positives and ensure accuracy

**Hallucination Prevention Techniques:**
```python
# Example prompt constraints
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Base ALL findings on the provided data only
- Do NOT make assumptions about missing information
- Use ONLY the security patterns and controls listed below
- Provide SPECIFIC remediation steps, not generic advice

CONSTRAINTS:
- If no issues found, return empty findings array
- Only include findings with clear evidence from the provided data
- Do not speculate about missing information
```

**Evidence of Success:**
```bash
# Validation confirms hallucination prevention
✅ Evidence-Based Findings Only: All findings backed by specific policy evidence
✅ Structured Output Validation: All responses contain required JSON fields
✅ Finding Structure Validation: All findings have valid structure and evidence
✅ Severity Level Validation: All severity levels are within valid constraints
```
